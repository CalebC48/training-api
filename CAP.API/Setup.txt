This project is mostly setup for you, but there are a few things you will need to do when you first start up

0. Rename your API and soultion files. You will have to open the the .sln file itself in Notepad++ 
or some other program and change the name to match there as well. It should look like an xml
file and you want to find this line 

Project("{9A19103F-16F7-4668-BE54-9A1E7A4F7556}") = "CAP.API", "CAP.API\CAP.API.csproj", "{C6DDD9B7-8ED0-4C17-9B9D-69DA158CBCCD}"

You'll want to replace the = "CAP.API" with = "[Your project]"

1. Update packages if you can
2. Update your connection string in the appsettings.json and appsettings.Development.json
3. Update the Process paths in web.config, web.Debug.config, and web.Release.config
4. Uncomment the build.yml file and update the target_folder variable
5. Scaffold / Migrate your models (if you have any)
6. Configure Startup.cs
7. Change the BYUAuthenticationHandler to match your database schema
8. Create an IIS launch profile. The tutorial on how to do that is here: https://lifesciences.byu.edu/kb/configuring-iis-for-a-new-api
9. Make sure your web.config file has the following lines after the closing tag of aspNetCore:

      <modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests="false">
        <remove name="WebDAVModule" />
      </modules>

      Without this, EF Core API's block PUT requests for some dumb reason.

For the context setup you can checkout the contextSetup.txt in the Models folder

When setting up the project, create a new project within sentry. Copy the DSN from the code it generates for you, and replace the dsn within the Program.cs.
Make sure to add `SentrySdk.CaptureException(ex);` to the catch block s so we can capture exceptions
